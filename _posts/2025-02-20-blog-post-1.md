I had a role that involved a lot of formatting rules. These rules ensured that our product would have a consistent, professional look meant to impress our clients. One such rule involved naming entries according to AP book title formatting rules. Over time, and after some turnover, it became apparent that not everyone was familiar with those rules. That's when I created the code that would become BiblioTech. BiblioTech is a simple, user-friendly script designed to format book titles according to either the American Psychological Association, Associated Press, Chicago Manual of Style, or Modern Language Association style guides. Simply enter the text, run the script, and let BiblioTech do what it does best.
