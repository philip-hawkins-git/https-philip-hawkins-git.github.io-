Welcome to my landing page. It is still very much under construction.

# Biography
I am a native Floridian from the St. Petersburg area. After receiving a Master's Degree in American History, I found myself out of money and in need of work. Thanks to a friend, I learned of a job opportunity in market research and data analysis. To my initial surprise, it was a good fit. Over the years, I have learned much on the job and also through continued learning institutions like Coursera.
